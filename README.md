## 🧠 About This Project

Hi, I’m Shaurya Mishra – a frontend-focused developer with a design-driven approach to problem-solving. **Accrue** was built to combine intuitive UI/UX with real-world utility in the finance domain.

This app is a **personal finance tracker** that’s fast, lightweight, and designed with responsiveness and clean interaction in mind.

---

## 🌟 Why I Built It

I wanted to solve a personal problem: keeping track of where my money goes.

But more than that, I built **Accrue** to strengthen my skills in:
- Designing clean user experiences
- Structuring scalable full-stack projects
- Exploring background jobs and async logic (with **Inngest** integration potential)
- Creating modern SPAs with **React + Vite**

---

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Add income and expenses
- 🧾 Categorize them by tag (e.g., Food, Rent, Salary)
- 📊 Track totals with summaries
- 🔐 sleek drag and drop feature 
- 🌐 Fully responsive, mobile-friendly design
- ⚙️ API-first backend with modular Express routes
- 🔁 Potential for async processing using [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com)
